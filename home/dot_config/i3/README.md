This repo contains my custom configuration for [I3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/).

Notes:

- $mod key is Mod4 (Windows key on most keyboards)
- A project is a set of workspaces with the format - (workspace-number):★(project-name)★(somenumber). Read more about this at [i3-project-focus-workflow](https://github.com/sainathadapa/i3-project-focus-workflow).
- [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) and [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) are the dependecies.

Instructions:

- Backup your i3 config!
- git clone --recursive git@github.com:sainathadapa/i3-wm-config.git ~/.i3
- Install [rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi//INSTALL.html)
- Install [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks)
- Done!
