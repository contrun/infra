# PyRadio Configuration File

# Player selection
# This is the equivalent to the -u , --use-player command line parameter
# Specify the player to use with PyRadio, or the player detection order
# Example:
#   player = vlc
# or
#   player = vlc,mpv, mplayer
# Default value: mpv,mplayer,vlc
player = mplayer,vlc,mpv

# Open last playlist
# If this option is enabled, the last opened playlist will be opened
# the next time PyRadio is opened. This option will take precedence
# over the "Def. playlist" option.
# Default value: False

# Default playlist
# This is the playlist to open if none is specified
# You can specify full path to CSV file, or if the playlist is in the
# config directory, playlist name (filename without extension) or
# playlist number (as reported by -ls command line option)
# Default value: stations

# Default station
# This is the equivalent to the -p , --play command line parameter
# The station number within the default playlist to play
# Value is 1..number of stations, "-1" or "False" means no auto play
# "0" or "Random" means play a random station
# Default value: False
default_station = False

# Default encoding
# This is the encoding used by default when reading data provided by
# a station (such as song title, etc.) If reading said data ends up
# in an error, 'utf-8' will be used instead.
#
# A valid encoding list can be found at:
#   https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
# replacing 2.7 with specific version:
#   3.0 up to current python version.

# Enable mouse
# If this options is enabled, the mouse can be used to scroll the

# Desktop notifications
# If this option is enabled, a Desktop Notification will be
# displayed using the notification daemon / service.
# If enabled but no notification is displayed, please refer to

# Connection timeout
# PyRadio will wait for this number of seconds to get a station/server
# message indicating that playback has actually started.
# If this does not happen (within this number of seconds after the
# connection is initiated), PyRadio will consider the station
# unreachable, and display the "Failed to connect to: [station]"
# message.

# Valid values: 5 - 60, 0 disables check
# Default value: 10

# Force http connections
# Most radio stations use plain old http protocol to broadcast, but

# use http; results depend on the combination of station/player.

# Default value: False

# Default theme
# Hardcooded themes:
#   dark (default) (8 colors)

# with an asterisk (i.e. '*my_theme')
# This is applicable for user themes only!
# Default value = 'dark'

# Transparency setting
# If False, theme colors will be used.
# If True and a compositor is running, the stations' window
# background will be transparent. If True and a compositor is
# not running, the terminal's background color will be used.
# Valid values: True, true, False, false
# Default value: False

# Calculated color factor
# This is to produce Secondary Windows background color
# A value of 0 dissables it, otherwise it is the factor
# to change (lighten or darken) the base color.
# For more info, please refer to

# Valid values: 0-0.2
# Default value: 0
